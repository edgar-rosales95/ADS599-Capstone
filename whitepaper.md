# Deep Learning-Based Plant Identification for Automated Agricultural Weed Control

---

## **Abstract**
This white paper explores the development of a deep learning–based plant identification system for automated agricultural weed control. Using a dataset of **15,336 annotated soybean field images**, four convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures—**Baseline CNN**, **ResNet-50**, **EfficientNetB0**, and **MobileNetV2**—were trained and evaluated to classify four categories: **broadleaf weeds**, **grass weeds**, **soil**, and **soybean crops**.  
To address severe class imbalance, especially in broadleaf samples, the study applied **synthetic image generation**, **aggressive data augmentation**, and **class weighting**. **MobileNetV2** emerged as the top performer for deployment feasibility, with **EfficientNetB0** achieving the highest overall accuracy. The final solution integrates into a **web application** with automated updates, enabling real-time classification and a planned cost savings calculator for farmers.

## **Business Background**
Weed management is a costly and labor-intensive challenge in agriculture, with annual expenditures exceeding **$900 million in California alone**. Weeds can reduce crop yields by up to **50%** while increasing herbicide use, contributing to **environmental degradation** and **herbicide resistance**. Traditional control methods rely heavily on **manual labor** and **chemical applications**, both of which face sustainability and cost pressures.  
Advances in **AI-powered computer vision** offer scalable solutions for identifying and managing weeds with greater efficiency and precision.

---

## **Problem Statement**
Farmers face increasing difficulty in managing weeds efficiently due to **labor shortages**, **escalating input costs**, and the **ecological risks** of herbicide overuse. Current weed identification systems lack robustness under real-world field variability.  
There is a need for an **accurate, lightweight, and deployable** model capable of distinguishing weeds from crops in diverse conditions to enable **automated, targeted weed control**.

---

## **Summary of the Findings**
- **Baseline CNN** – Provided a benchmark and improved with targeted augmentation (**broadleaf recall 0.71 → 0.86**).  
- **EfficientNetB0** – Initially overfit to soybean; after fine-tuning and weighting, achieved **>99% accuracy** across all classes.  
- **MobileNetV2** – Achieved **99% accuracy** with minimal misclassifications; best suited for **edge deployment**.  
- **ResNet-50** – Strong results but computationally heavier and less effective at distinguishing broadleaf from grass.

The combination of **aggressive augmentation**, **oversampling**, and **class weighting** proved essential for addressing class imbalance and improving generalization.

## **Business Questions**
1. Which CNN architecture provides the best balance of accuracy, inference speed, and deployment feasibility for agricultural weed detection?  
2. How can model performance be improved for underrepresented classes such as broadleaf weeds?  
3. What preprocessing and training strategies maximize generalization in varied field conditions?  
4. How can the system be deployed in a way that integrates seamlessly into farming operations?

## **Scope of Analysis**

**In Scope:**
- Classification of broadleaf, grass, soil, and soybean in still images.  
- Evaluation of four CNN architectures on the same dataset.  
- Data preprocessing, augmentation, and class imbalance handling.  
- Development of a proof-of-concept web application.  

**Out of Scope:**
- Real-time object detection or localization.  
- Integration with robotic weeding machinery in this phase.  
- Video stream classification and region-specific weed datasets.

## **Approach**
The dataset from Kaggle (“Weed Detection in Soybean Crops”) was **preprocessed** to standardize images at **224×224 pixels** with zero-padding.  
Class imbalance was addressed using:
- **Oversampling**
- **Aggressive augmentation** (rotation, flips, brightness shifts, zoom)
- **Class weighting**  

Four models were trained using a **stratified 80:20 train-validation split**.  
Performance was measured via **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, **F1-score**, and **confusion matrices**.  
Top-performing models were integrated into a **PHP-based web application** that updates automatically from the project’s GitHub repository.

---

## **Limitations**
- Class imbalance remains a challenge despite augmentation.  
- Models trained on this dataset may not generalize perfectly to other crops or weed species.  
- Deployment scenarios with variable lighting, occlusion, or unseen weed types may require retraining or additional fine-tuning.  
- Current system is limited to classification; it does not **localize** weeds in images.

## **Solution Details**
**MobileNetV2** and **EfficientNetB0** demonstrated the highest viability for real-world deployment:
- **MobileNetV2** – Ideal for edge devices due to its **small size** and **fast inference**.  
- **EfficientNetB0** – Achieved **near-perfect accuracy** through fine-tuning and class weighting.  

The **web application** enables stakeholders to:
- Visualize model performance
- Access updated confusion matrices
- (Future) Calculate estimated labor cost savings  

Automated **GitHub integration** ensures the system remains current without manual intervention.

---

## **Concluding Summary**
This project demonstrates that **lightweight CNN architectures**, combined with **targeted augmentation** and **class weighting**, can achieve high accuracy in weed vs. crop classification under varied field conditions.  
**MobileNetV2** offers a strong balance of **performance** and **efficiency** for field deployment, enabling **cost-effective, sustainable weed control**.  
The integration into a **web platform** bridges the gap between research and practical application.
